# Bird or Forest Classifier: Fine-tuned ResNet18 using fastai
A simple demonstration of " Is It A Bird?" problem with the help of Fast.ai api

This project implements a binary image classifier to solve the "Is it a bird?" problem. Key features:
- Image fetching from DuckDuckGo
- fastai DataBlock API for efficient data handling
- Transfer learning on pre-trained ResNet18
- Categorization based on 'bird' and 'forest' image folders

Explore how we leverage fastai and PyTorch to create a robust image classification model with minimal code.
